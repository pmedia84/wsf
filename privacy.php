                <h3>The Window Support Fund</h3>
                <p>The Window Support Fund is in no way, shape, or form associated with any government funding. If you do not qualify for the incentives offered by The Window Support Fund, we will check your eligibility for other support options that we run. Once we determine which option you qualify for, we will direct you to the appropriate company that we feel best suits your needs.</p>
                <p>If you do not qualify for assistance from The Window Support Fund, we will find the correct incentive for you. This may be a combination of finance or a private contribution from the company we refer you to. Once we have referred you to the third-party company as per your consent.</p>
                <p>The Window Support Fund provides assistance directly from its own resources. Unless you qualify for assistance, you will not receive financial support from The Window Support Fund toward the cost of your windows and doors. Any contributions will be given by the company to which The Window Support Fund refers you.</p>
                <p>The funding currently offers aid to people within a set qualifying criteria. As the fund is limited, we made the decision to help the most needy persons we find on a first-come, first-served basis. We currently offer assistance to single-parent homeowners with disabled or critically ill children under the age of 18, employed or self-employed. As more funding becomes available, this may change, and the company reserves the right to change its qualifying criteria without prior notice and offer assistance outside of this criteria at our discretion.</p>
                <p>When we contact you, you will be told what you qualify for. Unless you are told that you qualify for our fully funded incentive, our primary support program, you will be referred to another company that offers private incentives funded by and paid for by that company, not The Window Support Fund.</p>
                <p>The Window Support Fund, is funded by our partners in each area. This comes from a payment for each enquiry we pass to them.</p>
